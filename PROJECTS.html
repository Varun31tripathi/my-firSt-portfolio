    <H2>PROJECT 1: Online Bookstore Management System</H2>
    <p>This project involved developing a comprehensive online bookstore management system using Django and PostgreSQL. The system allows users to browse and purchase books, manage their accounts, and track orders. As part of this project, I implemented features such as user authentication, book search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. I also designed the database schema to efficiently store book information, user data, and transaction records. This project helped me enhance my skills in web development, database management, and user interface design.</p>

    <H2>PROJECT 2: Personal Portfolio Website</H2>
    <p>For this project, I created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing manner. I focused on creating a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The website includes sections for my biography, education, experience, and projects, along with a contact form for visitors to reach out to me. This project allowed me to improve my front-end development skills and gain experience in creating user-friendly web interfaces.</p>
